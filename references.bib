  abstract = {The scale-space technique introduced by Witkin involves
  generating coarser resolution images by convolving the original image
  with a Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by using the original image as
  the initial condition of a diffusion process. This approach has a major
  drawback; it is difficult to obtain accurately the locations of the
  'semantically meaningful' edges at coarse scales. In this paper we
  suggest a new definition of scale-space, and introduce a class of
  algorithms that realize it using a diffusion process. The diffusion
  coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage
  intra-region smoothing in preference to inter-region smoothing. It
  is shown that the 'No new maxima should be generated at coarse scales'
  property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region
  boundaries in our approach remain sharp, we obtain a high quality
  edge detector which successfully exploits global information. Experimental
  results are shown on a number of images. The algorithm involves simple,
  local operations replicated over the image making parallel hardware
  implementation feasible.},
