\section*{Legendre and Chebyshev Gaussian Quadrature} % =======================

It can be shown that for any class of orthogonal polynomials $p\in \mathbb{R}[x;2n+1]$ with corresponding weight function $w(x)$, there exists a set of points $\{x_i\}_{i=0}^n$ and weights $\{w_i\}_{i=0}^n$ such that
\[
\int_a^b p(x) w(x) dx = \sum_{i=0}^n p(x_i)w_i.
\]
Since this relationship is exact, a good approximation for the integral
\[
\int_a^b f(x) w(x) dx
\]
can be expected as long as the function $f(x)$ can be reasonably interpolated by a polynomial at the points $x_i$ for $i=0,1,\dots,n$.
In fact, it can be shown that if $f(x)$ is $2n+1$ times differentiable, the error of the approximation will decrease as $n$ increases.

Gaussian quadrature can be performed using any basis of orthonormal polynomials, but the most commonly used are the Legendre polynomials and the Chebyshev polynomials.
Their weight functions are $w_l(x)=1$ and $w_c(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, respectively, both defined on the open interval $(-1,1)$.

\begin{problem} % GaussianQuadrature.__init__().
\label{prob:gaussquad-init}
Define a class for performing Gaussian quadrature.
The constructor should accept an integer $n$ denoting the number of points and weights to use (this will be explained later) and a label indicating which class of polynomials to use.
If the label is not either \li{"legendre"} or \li{"chebyshev"}, raise a \li{ValueError}; otherwise, store it as an attribute.

The weight function $w(x)$ will show up later in the denominator of certain computations.
Define the reciprocal function $w(x)^{-1} = 1/w(x)$ as a \li{lambda} function and save it as an attribute.
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Calculating Points and Weights} % --------------------------------

% The first step of Gaussian quadrature is finding the weights and points that will be used.
% There are several important algorithms that will find the weights and points of quadrature.
% One based on a recurrence relationship inherent in all orthogonal polynomials will be considered in this lab.

All sets of orthogonal polynomials $\{u_k\}_{k=0}^{n}$ satisfy the three-term recurrence relation
\[
u_0=1,\qquad u_1 = x - \alpha_1,\qquad u_{k+1} = (x-\alpha_k)u_k - \beta_ku_{k-1}
\]
for some coefficients $\{\alpha_k\}_{k=1}^n$ and $\{\beta_k\}_{k=1}^n$.
% These constants have been calculated for several classes of orthogonal polynomials;
% there also exist algorithms for finding the coefficients for arbitrary classes of orthogonal polynomials.
%and may be determined for an arbitrary class using the procedure found in ``Calculation of Gauss Quadrature Rules'' by Golub and Welsch.
For the Legendre polynomials, they are given by
\[
\alpha_k=0, \qquad\qquad \beta_k=\frac{k^2}{4k^2-1},
\]
and for the Chebyshev polynomials, they are
\[
\alpha_k=0, \qquad\qquad \beta_k=\begin{cases} \frac{1}{2} &\mbox{ if } k = 1\\ \frac{1}{4} &\text{otherwise.} \\ \end{cases}
\]
Given these values, the corresponding \emph{Jacobi matrix} is defined as follows.
\[
J = \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_1 & \sqrt{\beta_1} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
\sqrt{\beta_1} & \alpha_2 & \sqrt{\beta_2} & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \sqrt{\beta_2} & \alpha_3 &  \ddots & 0 \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
%\vdots & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & & & \sqrt{\beta_{n-1}} \\
0 & \dots & & \sqrt{\beta_{n-1}} & \alpha_n
\end{bmatrix}
\]
According to the \emph{Golub-Welsch algorithm},\footnote{See \url{http://gubner.ece.wisc.edu/gaussquad.pdf} for a complete treatment of the Golub-Welsch algorithm, including the computation of the recurrence relation coefficients for arbitrary orthogonal polynomials.} the $n$ eigenvalues of $J$ are the points $x_i$ to use in Gaussian quadrature, and the corresponding weights are given by $w_i=\mu_w(\mathbb{R})v_{i,0}^2$ where $v_{i,0}$ is the first entry of the $i$th eigenvector and
$\mu_w(\mathbb{R}) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty w(x)dx$ is the \emph{measure} of the weight function.
Since the weight functions for Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials have compact support on the interval $(-1, 1)$, their measures are given as follows.
\[
\mu_{w_l}(\mathbb{R}) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty w_l(x)dx = \int_{-1}^{1} 1dx = 2
\qquad \qquad
\mu_{w_c}(\mathbb{R}) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty w_c(x)dx = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx = \pi
\]

%Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a tridiagonal matrix is a well conditioned problem.
%Using a good eigenvalue solver gives the Golub-Welsch algorithm a complexity of $O(n^2)$.

\begin{problem} % Jacobi matrix + points and weights.
\label{prob:jacobi}
Write a method for your class from Problem \ref{prob:gaussquad-init} that accepts an integer $n$.
Construct the $n\times n$ Jacobi matrix $J$ for the polynomial family indicated in the constructor.
Use SciPy to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $J$, then compute the points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and weights $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^n$ for the quadrature.
Return both the array of points and the array weights.

Test your method by checking your points and weights against the following values using the Legendre polynomials with $n=5$.
{\small
\[
\centering
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
    x_i
    & -\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{\frac{10}{7}}}
    & -\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{\frac{10}{7}}}
    & 0
    & \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{\frac{10}{7}}}
    & \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{\frac{10}{7}}}
    \\[1em] \hline
    w_i
    & \dfrac{322-13\sqrt{70}}{900}
    & \dfrac{322+13\sqrt{70}}{900}
    & \dfrac{128}{225}
    & \dfrac{322+13\sqrt{70}}{900}
    & \dfrac{322-13\sqrt{70}}{900}
\end{array}
\]
}
% Note that the order of the points and weights in the given table may differ.

Finally, modify the constructor of your class so that it calls your new function and stores the resulting points and weights as attributes.
\\(Note: The order of the points and weights in the table may differ depending on whether you used \li{scipy.linalg.eig()} or \li{scipy.linalg.eigh()}. The order doesn't matter but it is important that each point corresponds to the correct weight.)
\end{problem}

\begin{unittest}
In the file \li{test_gaussian_quadrature.py}, write unit tests for the \li{points_weights()} method in your \li{GaussianQuadrature} class. Some unit tests have been provided for Problem $1$. \\ \\
\textbf{Note:} The unit tests provided may have different attribute names than those you have written for your class. You may adjust the provided tests to match your code, or change your code to conform with the given tests.
\end{unittest}

\subsection*{Integrating with Given Weights and Points} % ---------------------

Now that the points and weights have been obtained, they can be used to approximate the integrals of different functions.
For a given function $f(x)$ with points $x_i$ and weights $w_i$,
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) w(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)w_i.
\]
There are two problems with the preceding formula.
First, the weight function is part of the integral being approximated, and second, the points obtained are only found on the interval $(-1,1)$ (in the case of the Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials).
To solve the first problem, define a new function $g(x) = f(x) / w(x)$ so that
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx
= \int_{-1}^{1} g(x) w(x) dx
\approx \sum_{i=1}^n g(x_i)w_i.
\label{eq:quadrature-no-shift}
\end{equation}

The integral of $f(x)$ on $[-1,1]$ can thus be approximated with the inner product $\w\trp g(\x)$, where $g(\x) = [g(x_1),\dots,g(x_n)]\trp$ and $\w = [w_1,\dots,w_n]\trp$.

\begin{problem} % Integrate with given points and weights.
Write a method for your class that accepts a callable function $f$.
Use \eqref{eq:quadrature-no-shift} and the stored points and weights to approximate of the integral of $f$ on the interval $[-1,1]$.
\\(Hint: Use $w(x)^{-1}$ from Problem \ref{prob:gaussquad-init} to compute $g(x)$ without division.)

% Remember that the weight function depends on the type of polynomial (the type should be stored as an attribute).
Test your method with examples that are easy to compute by hand and by comparing your results to \li{scipy.integrate.quad()} (The answer given below is found by using Chebyshev, even though the default mode is Lagrange.)
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from scipy.integrate import quad

# Integrate f(x) = 1 / sqrt(1 - x**2) from -1 to 1.
>>> f = lambda x: 1 / np.sqrt(1 - x**2)
>>> quad(f, -1, 1)[0]
3.141592653589591
\end{lstlisting}
\label{prob:gaussquad-no-shift}

\end{problem}

\begin{info}
Since the points and weights for Gaussian quadrature do not depend on $f$, they only need to be computed once and can then be reused to approximate the integral of any function.
The class structure in Problems \ref{prob:gaussquad-init}--\ref{prob:gaussquad-shift} takes advantage of this fact, but \li{scipy.integrate.quad()} does not.
If a larger $n$ is needed for higher accuracy, however, the computations must be repeated to get a new set of points and weights.
\end{info}

\subsection*{Shifting the Interval of Integration} % --------------------------

Since the weight functions for the Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials have compact support on the interval $(-1,1)$, all of the quadrature points are found on that interval as well.
To integrate a function on an arbitrary interval $[a,b]$ requires a change of variables.
Let \[u = \frac{2x - b - a}{b - a}\] so that $u = -1$ when $x = a$ and $u = 1$ when $x=b$.
Then
\[
x = \frac{b - a}{2}u + \frac{a + b}{2}\qquad \text{and}\qquad dx = \frac{b - a}{2}du,
\]
so the transformed integral is given by
\[
\int_a^b f(x) dx = \frac{b-a}{2}\int_{-1}^1 f\left(\frac{b-a}{2}u + \frac{a+b}{2}\right)du.
\]
By defining a new function $h(x)$ as
\[
h(x) = f\left(\frac{(b-a)}{2}x + \frac{(a+b)}{2}\right),
\]
the integral of $f$ can be approximated by integrating $h$ over $[-1,1]$ with \eqref{eq:quadrature-no-shift}.
This results in the final quadrature formula
\begin{equation}
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = \frac{b-a}{2}\int_{-1}^1 h(x)dx = \frac{b-a}{2}\int_{-1}^1 g(x)w(x)dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n g(x_i)w_i,
\label{eq:quadrature-complete}
\end{equation}
where now $g(x) = h(x) / w(x)$.

\begin{problem} % Shift the integral.
Write a method for your class that accepts a callable function $f$ and bounds of integration $a$ and $b$.
Use \eqref{eq:quadrature-complete} to approximate the integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$.
\\(Hint: Define $h(x)$ and use your method from Problem \ref{prob:gaussquad-no-shift}.)
\label{prob:gaussquad-shift}
\end{problem}

\begin{comment}
\section*{Numerical Integration with SciPy} % =================================

There are many other techniques for finding the weights and points for a given weighting function.
SciPy's \li{integrate} module provides some general-purpose integration tools.
For example, \li{scipy.integrate.quad()} is a reasonably fast Gaussian quadrature implementation.
Also included in the \li{integrate} module are fixed-precision and fixed-order Gaussian quadrature methods.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> from scipy.integrate import quad

>>> f = lambda x: np.cos(x) * np.sin(x)**2 # Function to integrate.
>>> g = lambda x: np.sin(x)**3 / 3         # Antiderivative.

# quad returns an array, the first entry is the computed value.
>>> calc = quad(f, -2, 3)[0]
>>> exact = g(3) - g(-2)                   # Exact value of the integral.
>>> np.<<abs>>(exact - calc)                   # Error of the approximation.
0.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}

% TODO: need to demonstrate this if it's to be included.
\begin{comment}
Another common hallmark of quadrature is that it can be used adaptively.
It is common in practice to refine the points of a quadrature estimate on an interval where a function is observed to be changing rapidly.
This allows for more accurate computation at a relatively low computational cost.
This is the approach used by the function \li{scipy.integrate.quad()}.
\end{comment}

\begin{problem} % Get error estimates by integrating the standard normal.
The \emph{standard normal distribution} has the following probability density function.
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-x^2/2}\]
This function has no symbolic antiderivative, so it can only be integrated numerically.
The following code gives an ``exact'' value of the integral of $f(x)$ from $-\infty$ to a specified value.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> from scipy.stats import norm

>>> norm.cdf(1)                     # Integrate f from -infty to 1.
0.84134474606854293
>>> norm.cdf(1) - norm.cdf(-1)      # Integrate f from -1 to 1.
0.68268949213708585
\end{lstlisting}
% The probability that a normally distributed random variable $X$ will take on a value less than (or equal to) a given value $x$ is \[ P(X \le x) = \int_{-\infty}^x p(t)dt = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-t^2/2} dt. \]

Write a function that uses \li{scipy.stats} to calculate the ``exact'' value
\[
F = \int_{-3}^2 f(x)dx.
\]
Then repeat the following experiment for $n=5,10,15,\ldots,50$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use your class from Problems \ref{prob:gaussquad-init}--\ref{prob:gaussquad-shift} with the Legendre polynomials to approximate $F$ using $n$ points and weights.
Calculate and record the error of the approximation.
\item Use your class with the Chebyshev polynomials to approximate $F$ using $n$ points and weights.
Calculate and record the error of the approximation.
\end{enumerate}
Plot the errors against the number of points and weights $n$, using a log scale for the $y$-axis.
Finally, plot a horizontal line showing the error of \li{scipy.integrate.quad()} (which doesn't depend on $n$).
Make sure your plot is clearly labeled.
\end{problem}


\section*{Multivariate Quadrature} % ==========================================

The extension of Gaussian quadrature to higher dimensions is fairly straightforward.
The same set of points $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and weights $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^n$ can be used in each direction, so the only difference from 1-D quadrature is how the function is shifted and scaled.
To begin, let $h:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and define $g:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by $g(x,y) = h(x,y)/(w(x)w(y))$ so that
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1 h(x,y)dx\:dy.
= \int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1 g(x,y)w(x)w(y)dx\:dy
\approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j g(z_i,z_j).
\label{eq:gaussquad-multivariable-scale}
\end{equation}
To integrate $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ over an arbitrary box $[a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]$, set
\[
h(x,y) = f\left(\frac{b_1 - a_1}{2}x + \frac{a_1 + b_1}{2},\
                \frac{b_2 - a_2}{2}y + \frac{a_2 + b_2}{2}\right)
\]
so that
\begin{equation}
\int_{a_2}^{b_2}\int_{a_1}^{b_1} f(x) dx\:dy
= \frac{(b_1 - a_1) (b_2 - a_2)}{4}\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1 h(x,y)dx\:dy.
\label{eq:gaussquad-multivariable-shift}
\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{eq:gaussquad-multivariable-scale} and \eqref{eq:gaussquad-multivariable-shift} gives the final 2-D Gaussian quadrature formula.
Compare it to \eqref{eq:quadrature-complete}.
\begin{equation}
\int_{a_2}^{b_2}\int_{a_1}^{b_1} f(x) dx\:dy
\approx \frac{(b_1 - a_1) (b_2 - a_2)}{4}
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j g(z_i,z_j)
\label{eq:quadrature-multivariate-complete}
\end{equation}

\begin{problem}
Write a method for your class that accepts a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ (which actually accepts two separate arguments, not one array with two elements) and bounds of integration $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$.
Use \eqref{eq:quadrature-multivariate-complete} to compute the double integral
\[\int_{a_2}^{b_2}\int_{a_1}^{b_1} f(x) dx\:dy.\]
% Note that we have assumed that we will be using the same number of points in both dimensions so the previous equation is valid.

Validate your method by comparing it \li{scipy.integrate.nquad()}.
Note carefully that this function has slightly different syntax for the bounds of integration.
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> from scipy.integrate import nquad

# Integrate f(x,y) = sin(x) + cos(y) over [-10,10] in x and [-1,1] in y.
>>> f = lambda x, y: np.sin(x) + np.cos(y)
>>> nquad(f, [[-10, 10], [-1, 1]])[0]
33.658839392315855
\end{lstlisting}
\end{problem}

\begin{info}
Although Gaussian quadrature can obtain reasonable approximations in lower dimensions, it quickly becomes intractable in higher dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality.
In other words, the number of points and weights required to obtain a good approximation becomes so large that Gaussian quadrature become computationally infeasible.
For this reason, high-dimensional integrals are often computed via \emph{Monte Carlo methods}, numerical integration techniques based on random sampling.
However, quadrature methods are generally significantly more accurate in lower dimensions than Monte Carlo methods.
\end{info}
