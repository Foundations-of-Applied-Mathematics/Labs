Consider a linear differential equation
\[Lu = f, \]
defined on the interval $[-1,1]$, together with associated boundary conditions.
We will approximate the solution $u(x)$ by a linear combination of $N+1$ basis functions $\phi_i$, so that
\[
u(x) \approx u_N(x) = \sum_{i=0}^N a_i \phi_i(x).
\]
To determine appropriate constants $a_i$, we then minimize the residual function
\[
R(x,u_N) = Lu_N - f.
\]
Note that $R(x,u) = Lu - f = 0$ for the true solution $u(x)$.

This general strategy is often called the method of mean weighted residuals (MWR method). The MWR method is a general framework that describes many other, more specific methods. These more specific methods come from differing approaches to minimizing the residual $R(x,u_N)$, and the choice of basis functions $\phi_i$.


\section*{The Pseudospectral Method}
The pseudospectral or collocation method is obtained from the MWR method by forcing the residual function $R(x,u_N)$ to equal zero at $N+1$ points in $[-1,1]$, called collocation points.
When done correctly, the pseudospectral method gives high accuracy and converges rapidly.

We will let the basis functions $\phi_i$ be the Chebyshev polynomials, 

\[T_0(x)=1\]
\[T_1(x)=x\]
\[T_{n+1}(x)=2xT_n(x)-T_{n-1}(x)\]
and the collocation points will be the Gauss-Lobatto points, $x_i = \cos(\pi i /N)$, $ i = 0, \ldots, N$.
The appropriate solution $u_N$ may be represented with two equivalent forms.
First, $u_N$ can be described with the first $N+1$ coefficients  $\{a_i\}_{i=0}^N$ of its expansion in the Chebyshev polynomials.
Since $u_N$ is a polynomial of order $N$, it may be uniquely described by its values at the collocation points, that is, the unknown values  $\{u_N(x_i)\}_{i=0}^N$.

These equivalent forms satisfy
\begin{align}
	MA = F \label{spectral1b:chebychev_expansion}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
	LU &= F \label{spectral1b:grid_point}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
	U_i &= u(x_i),\\
	A_i &= a_i,\\
	F_i &= f(x_i),\\
	L_{ij} &= \left.(LC_j(x))\right|_{x=x_i},\\
	M_{ij} &= \left.(L\phi_j(x))\right|_{x=x_i}.
\end{align*}

The functions $C_j$ above are the cardinal functions, defined to be the polynomials of least degree satisfying
\begin{equation*}
C_j(x_i) = \begin{cases} 1 & i=j \\ 0 & i \not = j.
   \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Thus, $u_N$ can also be expanded in the basis of the cardinal functions:
\begin{align*}
	u_N(x) &= \sum_{j=0}^N u_N(x_j)C_j(x).
\end{align*}

When $L = d/dx$, the matrix corresponding to equation \eqref{spectral1b:grid_point} is given by
\begin{align*}
L_{ij} &= \frac{dC_j}{dx}(x_i) =
\begin{cases} (1+2N^2)/6 & i=j=0, \\ -(1+2N^2)/6 & i=j=N, \\
-x_j/[2(1-x_j^2)] & i=j, \, 0<j<N, \\
(-1)^{i+j}\alpha_i/[\alpha_j(x_i-x_j)] & i \not = j.
   \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where $\alpha_0 = \alpha_N = 2,$ and $\alpha_j = 1$ otherwise.

This matrix is often called the differentiation matrix ($D$), and can be used to piece together the matrix $L$ for more complicated differential operators.
A stable, vectorized function to build the differentiation matrix is given below.


\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np

def cheb(N):
    x = np.cos((np.pi/N)*np.linspace(0,N,N+1))
    x.shape = (N+1,1)
    lin = np.linspace(0,N,N+1)
    lin.shape = (N+1,1)

    c = np.ones((N+1,1))
    c[0], c[-1] = 2., 2.
    c = c*(-1.)**lin
    X = x*np.ones(N+1) # broadcast along 2nd dimension (columns)

    dX = X - X.T

    D = (c*(1./c).T)/(dX + np.eye(N+1))
    D = D - np.diag(np.sum(D.T,axis=0))
    x.shape = (N+1,)
    # Here we return the differentiation matrix and the Chebyshev points,
    # numbered from x_0 = -1 to x_N = 1
    return D[::-1,::-1], x[::-1]

\end{lstlisting}



\section*{Using the Differentiation Matrix}


\begin{problem}
Use the differentiation matrix to numerically approximate the derivative of $u(x) = e^{x}\cos(6x)$ on a grid of $N$ Chebychev points where $N=6, 8,$ and $10.$
(Use the linear system $D U \approx U'$.)
Then use barycentric interpolation (\li{scipy.interpolate.barycentric_interpolate}) to approximate $u'$ on a grid of 100 evenly spaced points.

Graphically compare your approximation to the exact derivative.
Note that this convergence would not be occurring if the collocation points were equally spaced.
\end{problem}

To approximate $u''(x)$ on the grid $\{x_i\}$, we use
\[U'' \approx D^2 U.\]
The BVP
\begin{align*}
&{ }u'' = f(x), \quad x \in [-1,1],\\
&{ }u(-1) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0,
\end{align*}
can be discretized by the linear system
\begin{align}
	D^2 U &= F, \label{spectral1b:discretization}
\end{align}
where $F = [f(x_0),\ldots, f(x_N)]^T$.
Since we have Dirichlet boundary conditions of $0$, we can satisfy the boundary condition by forcing $U[0] = U[N] = 0$.
This is done by replacing the first and last equations in \eqref{spectral1b:discretization} by the boundary conditions.
% This allows us to ignore the first and last equations in the system, giving us the new system
% \[\tilde{D}^2 \tilde{U} = \tilde{F},\]
% where $\tilde{D} = D[1:N,1:N]$, $\tilde{U} = U[1:N]$, and $\tilde{F} = F[1:N]$.

\begin{lstlisting}
#The following code will force U[0] = U[N] = 0
D, x = cheb(N)    #for some N
D2 = np.dot(D, D)
D2[0,:], D2[-1,:] = 0, 0
D2[0,0], D2[-1,-1] = 1, 1
F[0], F[-1] = 0, 0
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{problem}
Use the pseudospectral method to solve the boundary value problem
\begin{align*}
&{ } u'' = e^{2x}, \quad x \in (-1,1), \\
&{ } u(-1) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0.
\end{align*}

Use $N=8$ in the \li{cheb(N)} method and use barycentric interpolation to approximate $u$ on 100 evenly spaced points.
Compare your numerical solution with the exact solution,
\[
u(x) = \frac{- \cosh(2) - \sinh(2)x + e^{2x}}{4}.
\]
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
	Use the pseudospectral method to solve the boundary value problem
	\begin{align*}
	&{ } u'' + u' = e^{3x}, \quad x \in (-1,1), \\
	&{ } u(-1) = 2, \quad u(1) = -1.
	\end{align*}
	
	Use $N=8$ in the \li{cheb(N)} method and use barycentric interpolation to approximate $u$ on 100 evenly spaced points.

Hint: Apply the Dirichlet boundary conditions to the left-hand side of the equation only \emph{after} adding the differentiation matrices $D+D^2$.
\end{problem}

The previous exercise involved setting up and solving a linear system 
\[
AU = F,
\]
where $F$ is a vector whose entries are $e^{3x}$ evaluated at the collocation points $x_j$, and $U$ represents the approximation to the solution $u$ at those points. 
However, whenever the ODE is nonlinear, the discretization becomes a nonlinear system of equations that must be solved using Newton's method. 
The next exercise contains a BVP whose ODE is nonlinear, with the additional complexity that the domain of the problem is not $[-1,1]$. 

\begin{problem}
Use the pseudospectral method to solve the boundary value problem
\begin{align*}
&{ } u'' = \lambda\sinh(\lambda u), \quad x \in (0,1), \\
&{ } u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 1
\end{align*}
for several values of $\lambda$: $\lambda = 4, 8, 12$. 
Begin by transforming this BVP onto the domain $-1<x<1$.
Use $N=20$ in the \li{cheb(N)} method and use barycentric interpolation to approximate $u$ on 100 evenly spaced points.
 
Below is sample code for implementing Newton's Method
\begin{lstlisting}
from scipy.optimize import root

N = 20
D, x = cheb(20)

def F(U):
	out = None	#Set up the equation you want the root of.
	#Make sure to set the boundaries correctly
	
	return out	#Newtons Method will update U until the output is all 0's.

guess = np.ones_like(x)    #Make your guess, same size as the cheb(N) output
solution = root(F, guess).x 
\end{lstlisting}

Hint: use an array of ones for your guess, as shown in the code above.
\end{problem}



\section*{Minimizing the Area of a Surface of Revolution}
A surface of revolution that minimizes its area is an example of a larger class of surfaces called minimal surfaces. A famous example of a minimal surface is a soap bubble. Soap bubbles minimize their surface area while containing a fixed volume of air. This behavior extends to merged bubbles, and a soap film whose boundary is a wire frame. Minimal surfaces have applications in molecular engineering and material science, and general relativity, where they describe the apparent horizon of a black hole.

Consider a function $y(x)$ defined on $[-1,1]$ satisfying $y(-1) = a $, $y(1) = b. $ The area of the surface obtained by revolving the graph of $y(x)$ about the $x$-axis is given by
\[T[y(x)] = \int_{-1}^1 2 \pi y(x) \sqrt{1 + (y'(x))^2}\, dx .\]
To find the function $y(x)$ whose surface of revolution minimizes surface area, we must minimize the functional $T[y]$.
This is a classical problem from a branch of mathematics called the calculus of variations.
Standard derivatives allow us to find the minimum values of functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and where they occur.
The calculus of variations allows us to find the minimum values of functions whose input are other functions.

From the calculus of variations we know that a necessary condition for $y(x)$ to minimize $T[y]$ is that the Euler-Lagrange equation must be satisfied:
\begin{align*}
	L_y - \frac{d}{dx}L_{y'} = 0,
\end{align*}
where $L(x,y,y') = 2 \pi y \sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$.
Simplifying the Euler-Lagrange equation for our problem results in the ODE
\[y y'' - (y')^2 -1 = 0.\]
Discretizing this ODE using the pseudospectral method results in the (nonlinear) system of equations
\[
Y \odot (D^2 Y) - (DY) \odot (DY) - \mathbf{1} = 0,
\]
where $\odot$ is the Hadamard product (denoting element-wise multiplication) and  $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones.

\begin{problem}
Find the function $y(x)$ that satisfies $y(-1) = 1$, $y(1) = 7$, and whose surface of revolution (about the $x$-axis) minimizes surface area.
Compute the surface area, and plot the surface. \label{prob:pseudospectral1:minimal_surface}
Use $N=50$ in the \li{cheb(N)} method and use barycentric interpolation to approximate $u$ on 100 evenly spaced points.

Below is sample code for creating the 3D wireframe figure.
\begin{lstlisting}


barycentric = None #This is the output of barycentric_interpolate() on 100 points

lin = np.linspace(-1,1,100)
theta = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,401)
X, T = np.meshgrid(lin, theta)
Y, Z = barycentric*np.cos(T), barycentric*np.sin(T)
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='b', rstride=10, cstride=10, lw=0.5)
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

Hint: use a vector of twos as the initial guess. This problem is sensitive to initial conditions.
